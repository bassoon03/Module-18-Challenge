This repository contains the CitiBike data as a csv file, the Jupyter notebook in which the data was cleaned, and the Markdown files that describe the Tableau Story. Some of the code for the cleaning was based
on code from Saturn Cloud. I had to refer to some outside sources on how to use datetime. I don't remember specifically what I used, but it was probably standard documentation or some similar website. Aside from
the code from Saturn Cloud, no actual code was copied.
