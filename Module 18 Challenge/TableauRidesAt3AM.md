# Tableau Rides at 3 AM

Notice that the number of rides occurring within each hour of the day hits a low point at the end of the third hour, that is, 3 in the morning. This is also when the sum trip duration hits a low point. The curious thing is that at this same time, the average trip duration peaks for the whole day. I think most people would expect it to peak at a busier time of day. At first, this occurrence may seem odd, but quite probably it is the low number of rides which enables this. This is because the average trip duration is calculated by dividing the sum trip duration for each hour by the number of rides in each hour. The smaller the number of rides, the higher the average. If there is a sufficiently low number of rides, then even with a relatively small amount of time spent traveling, the average trip duration could be quite high. Throughout the rest of the day, the sum trip duration by hour is a good deal higher, but so is the number of rides at each hour. This opens the possibility for the average trip duration to peak at the least busiest hour.
